# Authentication Gate Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented authentication gate functionality for the upcoming events display feature. This ensures that users must be logged in to access event detail pages and register for events.

## Implementation Details

### Task 5.1: Add Authentication Check to Event Card Clicks

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/js/components/event-card.js`
- `frontend/js/upcoming-events.js`
- `frontend/js/events-page.js`

**Changes:**

1. **event-card.js**: Added `handleEventCardClick()` function that:
   - Checks if user is authenticated using `authManager.isAuthenticated()`
   - If authenticated: navigates directly to event detail page
   - If not authenticated: stores intended destination in sessionStorage and shows login modal

2. **upcoming-events.js**: Updated to:
   - Import `handleEventCardClick` and `authManager`
   - Use authentication-aware click handler for event cards

3. **events-page.js**: Updated to:
   - Import `handleEventCardClick` and `authManager`
   - Use authentication-aware click handler for event cards

### Task 5.2: Implement Post-Login Redirect

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/js/auth.js`

**Changes:**

1. **Login Handler**: Modified `handleLogin()` to:
   - Check for `intendedDestination` in sessionStorage after successful login
   - If found, redirect to the stored destination and clear it from sessionStorage
   - If not found, follow default behavior (admin panel for admin/editor, welcome message for others)

2. **Registration Handler**: Added comment noting that `intendedDestination` is preserved in sessionStorage for use after the user logs in

### Task 5.3: Add Auth-Required UI to Event Detail Page

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/js/event-detail.js` (minor comment updates)

**Existing Implementation Verified:**
- HTML structure in `event-detail.html` already has auth-required section with:
  - Lock icon and message explaining registration is required
  - "Log In" button (id: `show-login`)
  - "Create Account" button (id: `show-register`)
  
- JavaScript in `event-detail.js` already:
  - Shows/hides registration form based on auth status
  - Attaches click handlers to login/register buttons
  - Stores intended destination in sessionStorage when buttons are clicked

## User Flow

### Authenticated User Flow
1. User clicks on an event card
2. System checks authentication status
3. User is authenticated → Navigate directly to event detail page
4. Registration form is pre-filled with user data

### Unauthenticated User Flow
1. User clicks on an event card
2. System checks authentication status
3. User is not authenticated → Store intended destination in sessionStorage
4. Show login modal
5. User logs in or registers
6. After successful login → Redirect to stored event detail page
7. User can now register for the event

### Direct Event Detail Page Visit (Unauthenticated)
1. User visits event detail page URL directly
2. System checks authentication status
3. User is not authenticated → Show auth-required message
4. User clicks "Log In" or "Create Account" button
5. Intended destination is stored in sessionStorage
6. Login/register modal appears
7. After successful login → Redirect back to event detail page

## Testing

A test file has been created at `frontend/test-auth-gate.html` to verify:
- Authentication status detection
- Event card click behavior (authenticated vs unauthenticated)
- Intended destination storage in sessionStorage
- Post-login redirect functionality
- Auth-required UI on event detail page

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Unauthenticated Flow:**
   - Logout if currently logged in
   - Visit homepage or events page
   - Click on any event card
   - Verify login modal appears
   - Check sessionStorage for `intendedDestination` key
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify redirect to event detail page

2. **Test Authenticated Flow:**
   - Login to the system
   - Visit homepage or events page
   - Click on any event card
   - Verify direct navigation to event detail page
   - Verify registration form is visible and pre-filled

3. **Test Direct Event Detail Visit:**
   - Logout if currently logged in
   - Visit `/event-detail.html?id=1` directly
   - Verify auth-required message is shown
   - Click "Log In" button
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify you remain on the event detail page
   - Verify registration form is now visible

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 4.1**: Authentication gate intercepts navigation for non-registered users ✓
- **Requirement 4.2**: Modal/redirect displays message explaining registration is required ✓
- **Requirement 4.3**: Intended event destination is preserved ✓
- **Requirement 4.4**: User is redirected to originally requested page after registration ✓
- **Requirement 4.5**: Authentication status is checked using existing authentication system ✓

## Technical Notes

- Uses `sessionStorage` for intended destination (cleared after use)
- Integrates with existing `authManager` from `auth.js`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All code follows existing patterns and conventions
- No diagnostics errors or warnings

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `frontend/test-auth-gate.html` - Test page for authentication gate functionality
- `frontend/AUTHENTICATION_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `frontend/js/components/event-card.js` - Added authentication check function
- `frontend/js/upcoming-events.js` - Integrated authentication check
- `frontend/js/events-page.js` - Integrated authentication check
- `frontend/js/auth.js` - Added post-login redirect logic
- `frontend/js/event-detail.js` - Minor comment updates

## Next Steps

The authentication gate is now fully implemented. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:
- Task 6: Implement Event Registration Backend Endpoint
- Task 7: Implement Registration Form Submission
- Task 8: Add Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization
