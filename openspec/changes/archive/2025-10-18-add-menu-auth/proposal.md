# Menu Authentication Links Proposal

## Why
The homepage currently lacks visible access to login and registration functionality. Users need easy access to authentication features directly from the main navigation to access backend functionality and create new accounts.

## What Changes
- Add "Login" and "Register" links to the main navigation menu bar
- Position authentication links prominently in the header (right side)
- Ensure responsive design for mobile menu
- Style consistently with existing navigation elements
- Link to authentication pages/modals

## Impact
- Affected specs: frontend navigation
- Affected code: 
  - Frontend: index.html navigation structure
  - CSS: responsive menu styling
  - JavaScript: mobile menu functionality
