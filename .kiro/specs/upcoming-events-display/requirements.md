# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the frontend homepage to display upcoming events with a visually appealing layout inspired by the reference design. It includes date badges showing year and month/day, event titles and descriptions, and individual registration detail pages for each event. The system implements authentication-based access control where registered users can access registration pages while non-registered users are prompted to register. The homepage displays the four most recent events, with additional events shown in a waterfall/masonry layout on a dedicated events page.
