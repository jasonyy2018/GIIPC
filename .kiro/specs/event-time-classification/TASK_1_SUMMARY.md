# Task 1: Database Schema Updates - Completion Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Migration Script Created
- **File**: `backend/migrations/003_add_event_time_classification.sql`
- **Purpose**: Add time classification fields to events and conferences tables

### 2. Database Schema Changes

#### Events Table
- ✅ Added `start_date` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL column
- ✅ Added `end_date` TIMESTAMP column (nullable)
- ✅ Added CHECK constraint: `end_date >= start_date`
- ✅ Migrated existing data from `date` field to new time fields
- ✅ Created 4 performance indexes:
  - `idx_events_start_date` - Sort by start date
  - `idx_events_end_date` - Sort by end date
  - `idx_events_end_date_start_date` - Composite index for filtering
  - `idx_events_null_end_date` - Partial index for ongoing events

#### Conferences Table
- ✅ Added `start_date` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL column
- ✅ Added `end_date` TIMESTAMP column (nullable)
- ✅ Added CHECK constraint: `end_date >= start_date`
- ✅ Set default timestamps for existing data
- ✅ Created 4 performance indexes:
  - `idx_conferences_start_date` - Sort by start date
  - `idx_conferences_end_date` - Sort by end date
  - `idx_conferences_end_date_start_date` - Composite index for filtering
  - `idx_conferences_null_end_date` - Partial index for ongoing conferences

### 3. Migration Scripts Created
- ✅ `backend/scripts/run-time-classification-migration.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- ✅ `backend/scripts/run-time-classification-migration.bat` (Windows)
- ✅ `backend/scripts/verify-time-classification-migration.sql` (Verification)

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `backend/schema.sql` with new fields and indexes
- ✅ Created `backend/migrations/README.md` with migration guide
- ✅ Added column comments for documentation

## Verification Results

### Events Table
- Total events: 4
- Events with start_date: 4 (100%)
- Events with end_date: 4 (100%)
- Valid date ranges: 4 (100%)

### Conferences Table
- Total conferences: 0
- Schema ready for new conferences with time fields

### Constraints Verified
- ✅ `check_events_dates` constraint active
- ✅ `check_conferences_dates` constraint active
- ✅ Tested: Invalid date ranges are rejected (end_date < start_date)
- ✅ Tested: Valid date ranges are accepted

### Indexes Verified
- ✅ All 8 indexes created successfully
- ✅ Partial indexes working for NULL end_date filtering
- ✅ Composite indexes ready for time-based queries

## Data Migration

### Events
- Existing `date` field preserved for backward compatibility
- `start_date` populated from `date` field
- `end_date` set to next day (date + 1 day)
- All 4 existing events migrated successfully

### Conferences
- Existing `date_range` field preserved
- Default timestamps set for future manual updates
- No existing conferences to migrate

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `backend/migrations/003_add_event_time_classification.sql`
2. `backend/scripts/run-time-classification-migration.sh`
3. `backend/scripts/run-time-classification-migration.bat`
4. `backend/scripts/verify-time-classification-migration.sql`
5. `backend/migrations/README.md`
6. `.kiro/specs/event-time-classification/TASK_1_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified
1. `backend/schema.sql` - Updated with new fields, constraints, and indexes

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **Requirement 1.1**: Database supports time-based event classification
- ✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Database supports time-based conference classification
- ✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Backend can filter by time (schema ready)
- ✅ **Requirement 6.1**: UTC time storage implemented

## Next Steps

The database schema is now ready for the next tasks:
- Task 2: Backend API Extensions - Events
- Task 3: Backend API Extensions - Conferences

The backend controllers can now query events and conferences using the new time fields to implement active/past filtering logic.

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Migration executed successfully
2. ✅ Schema verification completed
3. ✅ Data migration verified
4. ✅ Constraint validation tested
5. ✅ Index creation verified
6. ✅ Sample queries tested

## Notes

- Old `date` and `date_range` fields preserved for backward compatibility
- All times stored in UTC as per design requirements
- Partial indexes optimize queries for active vs past events
- CHECK constraints ensure data integrity at database level
